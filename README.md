# Meds: net healing

**Meds** is a high-performance firewall system written in Go.  
It integrates with Linux Netfilter via **NFQUEUE**, inspects inbound traffic in user space, and applies filtering to block malicious or unwanted traffic in real time.

*Meds ‚Äî "net healing" firewall designed to cure your network from malicious traffic.*

---

## üöÄ Usage

**Requirements:**
- [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.24](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.24.0) or above.
- Linux with **iptables** + **NFQUEUE** support

Since Meds interacts directly with iptables and NFQUEUE, you must run it with **root privileges** (`sudo`).  
The application manages iptables rules automatically.

### Run the firewall

```bash
go build -o meds cmd/daemon/main.go
sudo ./meds
```

### Command-line options
```text
./meds -help
Usage of ./meds:
  -log-level string
        zerolog level (default "info")
  -loggers-count uint
        logger workers count (default 12)
  -max-packets-at-once uint
        max packets per ip at once (default 2000)
  -max-packets-cache-size uint
        max packets per ip cache size (default 100000)
  -max-packets-cache-ttl duration
        max packets per ip cache ttl (default 3m0s)
  -max-packets-per-second uint
        max packets per ip per second (default 100)
  -metrics-addr string
        prometheus metrics address (empty for disable) (default ":8000")
  -update-interval duration
        update frequency (default 12h0m0s)
  -update-timeout duration
        update timeout (per filter) (default 10s)
  -workers-count uint
        nfqueue workers count (default 12)
```

### Prometheus metrics

By default, metrics are exposed at:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```
You can change the bind address using the `-metrics-addr` flag.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **NFQUEUE-based packet interception**  
  Uses Linux Netfilter queues to copy inbound packets into user space with minimal overhead.

- **Fast packet parsing with [gopacket](https://github.com/google/gopacket)**  
  Parses traffic efficiently (`lazy` and `no copy` modes enabled).

- **Lock-free core**  
  Meds itself does not use any mutexes ‚Äî all packet filtering, counters, and token buckets are built with atomic operations.  
  Dependencies like [otter/v2](https://github.com/maypok86/otter) may use fine-grained internal locks, but the Meds processing pipeline remains fully lock-free and highly concurrent.

- **Blacklist-based filtering**  
  - IP blacklists: [FireHOL](https://iplists.firehol.org/), [Spamhaus DROP](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/), [Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/)  
  - Domain blacklists: [StevenBlack hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/), [SomeoneWhoCares hosts](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/)

- **Rate Limiting per IP**  
  Uses token bucket algorithm to limit burst and sustained traffic per source IP.  
  Protects against high-frequency floods (SYN, DNS, ICMP, or generic packet floods).

- **Prometheus integration**  
  Exposes metrics for observability:
  - Total packets processed
  - Dropped packets (with reasons)
  - Accepted packets (with reasons)
 
- **Asynchronous logging**  
  Uses [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) with worker-based async logging for minimal overhead.

- **Efficient lookups**  
  Uses [radix tree](https://github.com/armon/go-radix) and [bart](https://github.com/gaissmai/bart) for IP/domain matching at scale.

- **Extensible design**  
  Modular architecture allows adding new filters (GeoIP, ASN, SNI/TLS filtering).

## üîç How It Works

1. **Packet interception**  
   All inbound packets are queued from Netfilter (`iptables` rule with `-j NFQUEUE`).

2. **Classification pipeline**  
   Packets go through multiple filters:
   - Global whitelist check (local network)
   - Rate Limiting check per IP (drops packets if token bucket exhausted)
   - IP blacklist check (source IP)
   - DNS Questions/Answers check (domains and CNAME chains)

3. **Decision engine**  
   - **ACCEPT** ‚Üí packet is safe, passed to kernel stack  
   - **DROP** ‚Üí packet is malicious, discarded immediately  

4. **Metrics & logging**  
   Every decision is counted and exported via Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.  
   All events are asynchronously logged to minimize packet processing latency.

## üìä Example Metrics (Prometheus)

```text
# Total number of accepted packets
meds_core_packets_accepted_total{filter="empty",reason="default"} 2165
meds_core_packets_accepted_total{filter="ip",reason="whitelisted"} 102

# Total number of dropped packets
meds_core_packets_dropped_total{filter="dns",reason="StevenBlack"} 3
meds_core_packets_dropped_total{filter="ip",reason="FireHOL"} 167

# Total number of processed packets
meds_core_packets_processed_total 2437
```
